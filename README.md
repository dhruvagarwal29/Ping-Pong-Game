# Ping-Pong-Game

##Demo Video -> https://youtu.be/m0GJXTHFM3o

## Project Description:
This project is a Java-based multiplayer game that simulates a ping pong match. It will use a graphical user interface (GUI) to display the game board and track the score for each player. The game will be designed with advanced Java concepts, such as data types and structures, inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, Java GUIs - Swing, Collections, keyboard events, and graphics.

## Gameplay:
The game will be played by two players, and the objective is to hit the ball back and forth without missing. If a player misses the ball, the other player scores a point. The game will become more challenging as the level progresses, making it more interactive for the players.

## Features:

- A graphical user interface that displays the game board and tracks the score for each player.
- Multiplayer functionality that allows two players to play against each other.
- Advanced Java concepts, such as data types and structures, inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, Java GUIs - Swing, Collections, keyboard events, and graphics.
- Increasing difficulty levels that make the game more interactive.
- Animations that add an engaging visual element to the game.

## Future Enhancements I am working on:

- Adding sound effects to enhance the gameplay experience.
- Adding AI functionality to enable players to play against the computer.
